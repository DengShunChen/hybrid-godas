source code for the `vtloc` and `bgvar` support utilities needed by the 3DVar.

These will go away eventually, it is more efficient for the code to be rolled back into the 3dvar executable. They were originally separated for reasons that I can't remember (something to do with thinking I need the vertical localization values before doing the observation preparation, which might have been true back when trying to do vertical localization based on vertical density gradients)

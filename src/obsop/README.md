The ocean observation operator and supporting programs.

Hopefully this will all be replaced by the JEDI UFO when that is ready.

This code produces the following executables when compiled:

| program | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `obsop` | Observation operator for conventional ocean variables. Mainly just converts model potential temperature to insitu temperature and does interpolation to observation points.|
| `obsprep_combine` | Combines multiple observation files generated by the other `obsprep_` executables and adjusts all observations times (hours) to be relative to the same reference time. Will do observation thinning if desired. |
| `obsprep_insitu` | Processes insitu T/S profiles. Mainly just calculates an estimated observation error profile|
| `obsprep_sst` | Process any GDS2.0 formatted SST file. Does superobbing and generates estimated observation error values. |
